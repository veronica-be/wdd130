    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <img src="images/catedral-palma.jpg" alt="Cathedral Le Seu in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.">
    <p>Palma of Mallorca, Spain is my favorite city because it has a special mix of history,
        culture, and natural beauty. When you walk through the city, you can see influences from
        different periods, such as Roman, Arab, and medieval times. The cathedral of La Seu is one
        of the most impressive landmarks, because it is next to the sea. The city has some old
        narrow streets, small squares, and historic buildings.</p>

    <p>The weather is usually warm, and the sea is always nearby, which creates a relaxed
        atmosphere. There are really beautiful beaches.</p>
