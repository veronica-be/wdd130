        <p>My name is Veronica Becerra Estrada, and I am Mexican. One of my greatest passions is
            pastry, and I hope that one day I can earn a pastry diploma from Le Cordon Bleu or
            another well-known pastry school. I enjoy following international pastry competitions,
            especially the Coupe du Monde de la Pâtisserie, because they inspire me to improve my
            creativity and discipline.</p>
        <p>At the moment, I am working on a yacht, which has given me the opportunity to see
            beautiful places and experience wonderful views in Italy, France, and Spain. At the same
            time, I am studying Software Development, and after completing my bachelor’s degree, I
            plan to study Aerospace Engineering. I am deeply interested in space, and my goal is to
            use my knowledge of technology and engineering to contribute to the aerospace field in a
            practical and meaningful way.</p>
